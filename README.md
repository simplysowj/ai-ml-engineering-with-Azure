# Project1 with Tensorflow:
Implementing a neural network with TensorFlow 
in this I have build a neural network using TensorFlow, train it on the Fashion MNIST dataset, and evaluate its performance.
Steps:
Load and preprocess a dataset using TensorFlow.

Define a neural network architecture using the Keras Sequential API.

Compile and train the neural network on a dataset.

Evaluate the model's performance using test data.

Experiment with different model parameters to enhance accuracy.
